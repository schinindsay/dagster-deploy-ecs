# Deploying to AWS ECS Using Docker Compose

This directory contains annotated files for deploying Dagster with an EcsRunLauncher to AWS ECS using Docker Compose. You can use these as a reference for configuring your own Dagster ECS deployment.

## Prerequisites

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/cloud/ecs-integration/#prerequisites)
2. [Create an AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/)
3. [Install the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)
4. [Configure IAM permissions](https://docs.docker.com/cloud/ecs-integration/#requirements)
5. [Create a Docker ECS context](https://docs.docker.com/cloud/ecs-integration/#create-aws-context):

```sh
docker context create ecs dagster-ecs
```

6. [Create ECR Repositories](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecr/create-repository.html) for our images:

```sh
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name deploy_ecs/webserver
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name deploy_ecs/daemon
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name deploy_ecs/user_code
```

7. [Log in to your ECR Registry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/getting-started-cli.html) (ensure that the $AWS_REGION environment variable is set to your registry's AWS region):

```sh
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --output text | cut -f1)
export REGISTRY_URL=$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com
aws ecr get-login-password --region $AWS_REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $REGISTRY_URL
```

## Build and Push Images

Our docker-compose.yaml builds all of its images from local multi-stage Dockerfile. To expose these images to ECS, we first need to build them and then push them to the ECR Repositories we created:

1. `docker compose build`
2. `docker compose push`

## Deploying Dagster

```sh
docker --context dagster-ecs compose --project-name dagster up
```

The first time you run this command, Docker will provision the necessary resources to run your stack on ECS. `--context dagster-ecs` tells Docker to run the containers on the Docker ECS context that we created. `--project-name dagster` tells Docker how to name the stack.

One of the resources Docker creates is an AWS ELB Load Balancer. You can access the Dagster webserver/UI on port 3000 of the Load Balancer's URL. To find the Load Balancer's URL, look for the [Load Balancer tagged with our project name](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home#LoadBalancers:tag:com.docker.compose.project=dagster-ecs).

Subsequent runs of this command will [execute a rolling update](https://docs.docker.com/cloud/ecs-integration/#rolling-update) of the stack.

## Destroying

Once you're done experimenting with this reference deployment, you should destroy the AWS resources it creates.

```sh
docker --context dagster-ecs compose --project-name dagster down
```

This will stop your running services and tear down any infrastructure Docker provisioned on your behalf.
